# FgSv Metrics Descriptions

This page contains descriptions of all metrics produced by all `fgsv` tools.  Within the descriptions
the type of each field/column is given, including two commonly used types:

* `Count` is an integer representing the count of some item
* `Proportion` is a real number with a value between 0 and 1 representing a proportion or fraction

**This page is autogenerated.  See the [contributing docs](03_Contributing.md) on how to re-generate.**

## Metric File Descriptions


### AggregatedBreakpointPileup

Aggregated cluster of breakpoint pileups

|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|id|String|Combined ID retaining the IDs of all constituent breakpoints|
|category|BreakpointCategory|Breakpoint category|
|left_contig|String|Contig name for left side of breakpoint|
|left_min_pos|Int|Minimum coordinate of left breakends|
|left_max_pos|Int|Maximum coordinate of left breakends|
|left_strand|Char|Strand at left breakends|
|right_contig|String|Contig name for right side of breakpoint|
|right_min_pos|Int|Minimum coordinate of right breakends|
|right_max_pos|Int|Maximum coordinate of right breakends|
|right_strand|Char|Strand at right breakends|
|split_reads|Int|Total number of split reads supporting the breakpoints in the cluster|
|read_pairs|Int|Total number of read pairs supporting the breakpoints in the cluster|
|total|Int|Total number of templates supporting the breakpoints in the cluster|
|left_pileups|PositionList|List of constituent left breakends|
|right_pileups|PositionList|List of constituent right breakends|
|left_frequency|Option[Double]|Proportion of templates mapping at one of the left breakends that support a breakpoint.                              If a template maps across multiple breakends, it is only counted once. If a template                              maps entirely between two breakends but does not overlap one, it is not counted. If two                              paired reads straddle a breakend, the template is counted as reading across the                              breakend. If two paired reads both overlap the same breakend, the template is counted                              once.|
|right_frequency|Option[Double]|Proportion of reads mapping at one of the right breakends that support a breakpoint|
|left_templates|Option[Int]|The total number of templates used for the denominator when calculating `left_frequency`.|
|right_templates|Option[Int]|The total number of templates used for the denominator when calculating `right_frequency`.|
|left_overlaps_target|Boolean|True if the left aggregated region overlaps a target region|
|right_overlaps_target|Boolean|True if the right aggregated region overlaps a target region|
|left_targets|Option[String]|The comma-delimited list of target names overlapping the left breakpoint|
|right_targets|Option[String]|The comma-delimited list of target names overlapping the right breakpoint|


### BedPE

A simple BEDPE record as defined by `bedtools`:- https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html#bedpe-format)Future compatibility could be implemented for supporting 10x flavored BEDPE files:- https://github.com/igvteam/igv/wiki/BedPE-SupportNote that the field `score` is allowed to be a string per bedtools!


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|chrom1|String||
|start1|Int||
|end1|Int||
|chrom2|String||
|start2|Int||
|end2|Int||
|name|String||
|score|String||
|strand1|Strand||
|strand2|Strand||


### BreakpointPileup

Represents a pileup of evidence (reads, read-pairs) for a breakpoint.  If `split_reads` is greater than
zero then the breakpoint location is supported at the sequence level and should be considered precise
though in the presence of repetitive sequence it may not be 100% accurate.  If `split_reads` is zero then
the only information comes from read-pairs and the breakpoint information should be considered imprecise.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|id|String|An ID assigned to the breakpoint that can be used to lookup supporting reads in the BAM.|
|left_contig|String|The contig of chromosome on which the left hand side of the breakpoint exists.|
|left_pos|Int|The position (possibly imprecise) of the left-hand breakend.|
|left_strand|Char|The strand of the left-hand breakend; sequence reads would traverse this strand                      in order to arrive at the breakend and transit into the right-hand side of the breakpoint.|
|right_contig|String|The contig of chromosome on which the left hand side of the breakpoint exists.|
|right_pos|Int|The position (possibly imprecise) of the right-hand breakend.|
|right_strand|Char|The strand of the right-hand breakend;. sequence reads would continue reading onto                      this strand after transiting the breakpoint from the left breakend|
|split_reads|Int|The number of templates/inserts with split-read alignments that identified this breakpoint.|
|read_pairs|Int|The number of templates/inserts with read-pair alignments (and without split-read alignments)                      that identified this breakpoint.|
|total|Int|The total number of templates/inserts that identified this breakpoint|
|left_targets|Option[String]|The comma-delimited list of target names overlapping the left breakpoint|
|right_targets|Option[String]|The comma-delimited list of target names overlapping the right breakpoint|
