# FgSv Metrics Descriptions

This page contains descriptions of all metrics produced by all `fgsv` tools.  Within the descriptions
the type of each field/column is given, including two commonly used types:

* `Count` is an integer representing the count of some item
* `Proportion` is a real number with a value between 0 and 1 representing a proportion or fraction

**This page is autogenerated.  See the [contributing docs](03_Contributing.md) on how to re-generate.**

## Metric File Descriptions


### BreakpointPileup

Represents a pileup of evidence (reads, read-pairs) for a breakpoint.  If `split_reads` is greater than
zero then the breakpoint location is supported at the sequence level and should be considered precise
though in the presence of repetitive sequence it may not be 100% accurate.  If `split_reads` is zero then
the only information comes from read-pairs and the breakpoint information should be considered imprecise.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|id|String|An ID assigned to the breakpoint that can be used to lookup supporting reads in the BAM.|
|left_contig|String|The contig of chromosome on which the left hand side of the breakpoint exists.|
|left_pos|Int|The position (possibly imprecise) of the left-hand breakend.|
|left_strand|Char|The strand of the left-hand breakend; sequence reads would traverse this strand                      in order to arrive at the breakend and transit into the right-hand side of the breakpoint.|
|right_contig|String|The contig of chromosome on which the left hand side of the breakpoint exists.|
|right_pos|Int|The position (possibly imprecise) of the right-hand breakend.|
|right_strand|Char|The strand of the right-hand breakend;. sequence reads would continue reading onto                      this strand after transiting the breakpoint from the left breakend|
|split_reads|Int|The number of templates/inserts with split-read alignments that identified this breakpoint.|
|read_pairs|Int|The number of templates/inserts with read-pair alignments (and without split-read alignments)                      that identified this breakpoint.|
|total|Int|The total number of templates/inserts that identified this breakpoint|
