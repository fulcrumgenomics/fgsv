# AggregateSvPileup

## Overview
**Group:** All tools

Merges nearby pileups of reads supporting putative structural variants.

Takes as input the file of pileups produced by `SvPileup`. That file contains a list of breakpoints, each
consisting of a chromosome, position and strand for each side of the breakpoint, as well as quantified read support
for the breakpoint.

This tool merges pairs of breakpoints that have their left and right ends on the same chromosomes, the same left
and right strands, and their left and right positions both within a length threshold. The merging behavior is
transitive. For example, two breakpoints that are farther apart than the length threshold can be merged if there
is a third breakpoint that is close to both.

The output file is a tab-delimited table with one record per aggregated cluster of pileups. Aggregated
pileups are reported with the minimum and maximum (inclusive) coordinates of all pileups in the cluster, a
possible putative structural variant event type supported by the pileups, and the sum of read support from all
pileups in the cluster.
